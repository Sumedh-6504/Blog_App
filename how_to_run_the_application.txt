BACKEND
1. First you have to activate the virtual environment by
.venv/Scripts/activate
Then the below command👇
(demo-fastapi) PS C:\Users\SANJANA MUNDEWADI\Desktop\CJ\Projects\Mini Projects - TWT\Demo-fastapi> uv run main.py     

it will start the application process

then you need to open the URL mentioned in the terminal after the process starts.. 
so after that it says there is no detail found or server not reached

Fix:-
in the url http://127.0.0.1:5000/
add docs in the end Like this
👇
http:127.0.0.1:5000/docs

then boom you get into the FastAPI docs created by default when you use fastapi libraries.

FRONTEND
2. frontend.py is saved in the root folder DEMO-FastAPI

Just run "uv run streamlit run frontend.py" in the root folder and that's it.
